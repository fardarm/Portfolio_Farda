# Farda Ramdhan

Greetings!
I'm Farda Ramdhan, a graduate in Geological Engineering from Padjadjaran University. I'm an adaptable and responsible person with a keen interest in Data Analytics and Data Science. My previous role as a laboratory assistant has equipped me with experience in data processing, analysis, extracting insights from datasets, and creating reports from various sources.
Currently, I am proficient in data analysis using Microsoft Excel (including Formulas, Pivot tables, and Power Query), and Python for data analysis and data science modeling. Additionally, I can operate Tableau and Google Data Studio for dashboard visualization. I am continuously learning to enrich my skills in the field of data.
I am always looking for opportunities and resources to expand my knowledge and data analysis skills. As a curious individual, I am passionate about challenging myself, a data-driven problem solver, and an endless learner.
